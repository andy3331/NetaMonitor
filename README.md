12/25/19 - I havent set up scheduling, I'm just running it off a daily scheduled task locally.
Also I have moved my webhook urls to productionwebhook.txt and testwebhook.txt files.
To use elsewhere you would need to create a discord webhook on your server and paste into one of these files.
To point to which key to use, change environment variable to prod or test.
